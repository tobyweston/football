# Story 1

Given a CSV feed of football scores, the system is able to load the scores and hold them internally.

* see [OpenCSV](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) for a possible CSV parser

## Acceptance Criteria

The customer views a list of football results within the system. No GUI is required, an internal representation is fine.
